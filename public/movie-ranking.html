<h1>The Best Movies According to Duncan</h1>
<h2>My top movies of all time!</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Usual Suspects</h3>
<p>Suspenseful, lots of action, and somehow still lighthearted. This is my mom's favorite movie... I am unable to have favorites it seems.</p>

<h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (Extended Edition)</h3>
<p>Just epic all around. Of course, it all stems from the books which are brilliant and transformative.</p>

<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>Anarchist classic. The ultimate glorification of mental health issues. Just a badass movie which, again, comes from a badass book.</p>
